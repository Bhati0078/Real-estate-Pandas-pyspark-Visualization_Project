### Real Estate Data Analysis and Visualization Project
   ## Overview
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive Real Estate Data Analysis and Visualization project that leverages the power of Python libraries such as Pandas, PySpark, and various data visualization tools to analyze and visualize real estate data. The project aims to provide insights into property trends, pricing, and market dynamics.
  ## Introduction
The real estate industry generates massive amounts of data related to property sales, pricing, location, and various attributes. This project aims to harness the power of data analysis and visualization to gain valuable insights into the real estate market. We use Python, Pandas, PySpark, and popular data visualization libraries to perform a detailed analysis of the dataset.
  ## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Data Collection: We acquire real estate data from various sources, ensuring it is comprehensive and clean.

Data Preprocessing: We clean, transform, and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis.

Data Analysis: Using Pandas and PySpark, we perform in-depth analysis, including summary statistics, trend analysis, and correlation studies.

Data Visualization: We create a variety of data visualizations, including bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and more, to communicate key findings effectively.

Results and Insights: We provide insights gained from the analysis and visualizations, shedding light on real estate market trends and pricing factors.



### Objective
The objective of this commit is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real estate dataset using both Pandas and PySpark. The analysis includes calculating various statistics, visualizing trends, and answering specific questions related to the dataset. The committed code covers tasks such as calculating average assessed values and sale amounts for each town, identifying the most common property type, exploring the median sale ratio for each residential type, examining the correlation between assessed value and sale amount, and more.

### Changes Made
1. Loaded the real estate dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and converted it into a PySpark DataFrame.
2. Calculated and visualized the average assessed values and sale amounts for each town using both Pandas and PySpark.
3. Identified the most common property type using Pandas and PySpark.
4. Explored the median sale ratio for each residential type, creating both a DataFrame and a pie chart for visualization.
5. Investigated the correlation between assessed value and sale amount using Pandas and PySpark.
6. Identified and visualized the top 10 most expensive properties sold in 2020 using Pandas and PySpark.
7. Explored the distribution of sale ratios for each town and the relationship between sale ratio and property type.
8. Examined the trend of sale ratios over time using both Pandas and PySpark, creating a line plot for visualization.
9. Identified the top 10 most profitable neighborhoods in terms of sale ratio using Pandas and PySpark.
10. Investigated the top 10 most expensive streets in terms of median sale price using both Pandas and PySpark, creating a pie chart for visualization.

### Additional Information
- Utilized various Pandas and PySpark functions for data manipulation and analysis.
- Incorporated matplotlib and PySpark SQL functions for data visualization.
- Addressed specific questions and objectives outlined in the code.
- Ensured clear and detailed documentation for each step of the analysis.
